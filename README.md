# Europeer-In - A CodeClan group project.

# The Brief:

Educational App

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive browser applications that display information in a fun and interesting way. Your task is to make an a Minimum Viable Product or prototype to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app.


**The chosen topic for the project was Europe, specifically, European countries.**

## MVP

A user should be able to:

- view educational content on a country
- be able to interact with a map to read about a chosen country

## Extensions

- Use an API to bring in more content on European countries, and store that information in a database.
- Have a variety of quizzes for the user to test their new found knowledge

## Resources used

- React
- Bootstrap
- Leaflet
- MongoDB

## Achievements

- Learnt how to manipulate data and load mongoDB with different data sources. 
- Learnt how a filter and search bar can be implemented. 
- Was able to get to grips with Bootstrap for the first time to complete CSS features. 
- More experience with agile methodologies, such as leading daily standups in turn as well as paired and mob programming any issues encountered to help resolve as a group. 

## Things we could have done differently

- The importance of planning - having completed our MVP, a more thorough reassessment of where we were going as a group could have led to a more refined outcome, we rushed into things a bit. 
- The importance of checking branch merges thoroughly - missing a couple of lines put us back a significant amount of time before we resolved the issue. 
-  The base of the quiz could be used to create different quizzes using the information stored in the database with a few tweaks, could have potentially added one or two more but could not due to time constraints.

## To run

From the command line:

- Cd to server package and use: npm install, npm run seeds and npm start to populate and run the backend of the app. 
- In a different tab, cd to client package and again, npm install and npm start to enable and open the frontend.  
- Navigate to the react URL, typically http://127.0.0.1:3000.
